      <h1>Hi, I'm Nicole.</h1>
      <p>Welcome to this little window into my life.</p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.
        Sometimes I code in my free time - you can check out some of my projects
        <Link to="/projects"> here</Link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy drawing, reading, crocheting, listening to music, watching
        movies and tv shows, and playing video games.
      </p>
